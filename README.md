# asteroid-geospatial-microservices-bachelor-thesis
Academic project implementing a scalable microservices platform for geospatial asteroid data analysis and visualization

## Overview

This project was developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis and focuses on building a microservices architecture for processing, integrating, and visualizing geospatial asteroid data.

Technologies used include Node.js, MongoDB, SQL databases, Cesium for 3D visualization, and Pentaho Kettle for ETL processes.

## Features
- Microservices architecture for data ingestion & processing  
- REST APIs for data access  
- Interactive 3D visualization of asteroid geospatial data  
- ETL workflows using Pentaho Kettle  

## Architecture

The system uses:
- Node.js services for API endpoints  
- MongoDB & SQL for data persistence  
- Cesium for 3D visualization  
- Pentaho Kettle for ETL pipelines  

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (Node.js)  
- MongoDB & SQL  
- Cesium  
- Pentaho Kettle  
- REST APIs


## What I Learned

- Designing and building scalable APIs  
- Working with microservices and data pipelines  
- Handling spatial/geospatial data  
- Frontend and backend integration
